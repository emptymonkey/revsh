# revsh #

_revsh_ is a tool for establishing [reverse shells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_shell) with [terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) support, reverse [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) for [advanced pivoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)#Pivoting), as well as arbitrary data tunneling.

**What is a "reverse shell"?**

A reverse shell is a network connection that grants [shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29) access to a remote host. As opposed to other remote login tools such as [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) and [ssh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), a reverse shell is initiated by the remote host. This technique of connecting outbound from the remote network allows for circumvention of firewalls that are configured to block inbound connections only. 

**What is a "reverse VPN"?**

_revsh_ is capable of attaching a virtual ethernet card (tun/tap) to both ends of its crypto tunnel. These cards can then be used to forward raw IP packets or ethernet frames. When combined with an Iptables NAT rule, or bridging a real ethernet card, this allows for the operator to receive a fully routable IP address on the target machines network. This, essentially, is a full VPN that has performed a connect-back call to the operator to circumvent in-bound packet filtering and grant the operator full network access.

**What is a "bind shell"?**

A [bind shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode#Remote) is a shell that is served from a normal forward network connection. _revsh_ supports both reverse and bind shells. To invoke a bind shell you can either invoke the _-b_ flag on both ends of the connection, or invoke the binary as '_bindsh_'.


**Can't I just use [netcat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat)?**

There are [many techniques](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) for establishing a reverse shell, but these methods don't provide terminal support. _revsh_ allows for a reverse shell whose connection is mediated by a [pseudo-terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal), and thus allows for features such as:

 * [job control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control)
 * [control character processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character) (e.g [Ctrl-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-C))
 * [auto-completion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-completion)
 * support for programs requiring a [controlling tty](https://github.com/emptymonkey/ctty) (e.g. vi)
 * [processing of window re-size events](http://linux.die.net/man/4/tty_ioctl)

In addition, _revsh_ also offers the following features:
 * [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) support.
 * Circumvents [utmp / wtmp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utmp). (No login recorded.)
 * Processes [rc file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_commands) commands upon login for easy scripting.
 * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) encryption with key based authentication baked into the binary.
 * Anonymous [Diffie-Hellman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) encryption upon request.
 * Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman encryption as default. (Now with more [Perfect Forward Secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)!)
 * [Cert pinning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Certificate_pinning) for protection against [sinkholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) and [mitm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) counter-intrusion.
 * Connection timeout for remote process self-termination.
 * Randomized retry timers for non-predictable auto-reconnection.
 * Netcat style non-interactive data brokering for file transfer.
 * Proxy support: point-to-point, SOCKS 4, SOCKS 4a, and SOCKS 5. Proxys are available in both directions for complete flexibility.
 * TUN / TAP support for forwarding raw IP packets / Ethernet frames.
 * Escape sequence commands to kill non-responsive nodes, or print connection statistics.


_revsh_ is intended as a supplementary tool for a [pentester's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentester) toolkit that provides the full set of terminal features across an encrypted tunnel. All together in a small (~75k) easy to use binary.

**Where can I use _revsh_?**

_revsh_ was developed on x86_64 Linux. Here is a brief list of Arch / OS combinations that it has been used on:
 * x86_64 Linux
 * i686 Linux
 * amd64 FreeBSD

(If you have successfully used revsh on another platform, drop me a line and I'll add it to the list.)

## Installation ##

	sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev     # Pre-req for building.
	git clone https://github.com/emptymonkey/revsh.git
	cd revsh
	vi config.h        # Set up new defaults that fit your situation.
	make               # This *can* take a very long time, though it usually doesn't.
	make install
	cd ~/.revsh
	vi rc              # Add your favorite startup commands to really customize the feel of your remote shell.
	revsh -h

## Compatability Note! ##

_revsh_ was developed with OpenSSL 1.0.2. Kali linux now ships with OpenSSL 1.1.0. There are notable changes to the API. Currently _revsh_ will not build with OpenSSL 1.1.0. (See Issue \#10.) This is being worked on, but no timeline set for a fix. I may take the opportunity to move away from OpenSSL entirely. Sorry for the inconvienience.
